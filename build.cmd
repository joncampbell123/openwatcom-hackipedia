REM build.cmd - build Open Watcom using selected compiler
REM
REM will build the builder, wattcp, watcom and installer
REM
REM combined OS/2, eCS and Windows version
REM
REM If first argument is "self", uses tools in rel2 to build,
REM requiring customized devvars.cmd. Otherwise, customized
REM myvars.cmd is needed. If the appropriate file does not exist,
REM owconfig.bat will be invoked to automatically generate it.
REM If running on OS/2 or eCS, it has to be created manually.
REM
REM Call without parms for "builder rel2" operation -> build
REM Call with clean for "builder clean"  operation  -> build clean
REM --> requires a customized setvars.bat/cmd named myvars.cmd
REM --> set WATCOM to the existing OW 1.x installation
