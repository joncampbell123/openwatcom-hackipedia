:SUBSECT.The Screen
When you start up &edname, you will see something like the following:
:PICTURE file='vistart'.
The &edname screen has several windows.
:UL.
:LI.The top line of the screen
is the
:KEYWORD.menu bar
:CONT.,
which contains all of the menu choices, the current mode, and the current
time.
:LI.The large window below the menu bar is the
:KEYWORD.edit window
:PERIOD.
Since
&edname is a multiple file editor, you may have more than one edit window.
Other edit windows are usually covered by the current edit window, unless
you change the size and position of the edit windows.
:LI.The lower left corner of the screen contains the
:KEYWORD.status window
:PERIOD.
This
window typically shows the current row and column.
:LI.The majority of the bottom of the screen contains the
:KEYWORD.message window
:PERIOD.
This window displays all errors and informational messages.
:eUL.
:P.
In the edit window will be a flashing line.  This flashing line is the
cursor, and it indicates which line you are on and the position
within the line.
:P.
On the border of the edit window are a number of special symbols.  These
special symbols are referred to as
:KEYWORD.gadgets
:PERIOD.
:UL.
:LI.In the top left corner of the edit window is the gadget ('ð') that opens
up the menu for the window.
:LI.In the lower right corner of the edit window is the resize gadget ('').
When you click on this gadget with your mouse and then drag the mouse, you
can resize the edit window.
:LI.On the right hand side of the edit window is the scroll bar.  The
scroll bar has several components:
:LI.The scroll up ('') gadget.  When you click on this with your mouse,
the edit window scrolls up one line.
:LI.The scroll down ('') gadget.  When you click on this with your mouse,
the edit window scrolls down one line.
:LI.The scroll thumb ('Û').  The scroll thumb indicates the relative position
of the current line in the file.  When you click on the scroll thumb with
your mouse and drag it, you can move to a new position in the file.  If
you click with your mouse on the scroll bar above the scroll thumb, you
move one page up in the file.  If you click on the scroll bar below the
scroll thumb, you move one page down in the file.
