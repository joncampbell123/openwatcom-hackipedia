The following command descriptions show items within angle brackets (<>).
The angle brackets are there to indicate items that you may supply.
You are not required to type the brackets.  For example, <filename> simply
means that in the corresponding place in the command you should enter
the name of a file.  For example, <filename> may be replaced with
:ILLUST.
   test.c
:eILLUST.
and the brackets are not entered.
:P.
The command descriptions also show items inside double quotes (").  The
double quotes are used to indicate a literal option that you may supply.
You are not required to type the quotes.  For example, "-c" indicates
that in the corresponding place in the command you may enter
:ITALICS.-c
:PERIOD.
:P.
In the syntax model for each command, the upper-case characters represent
the minimal truncation of the command.
