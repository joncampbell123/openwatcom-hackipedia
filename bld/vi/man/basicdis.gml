You have now made a number of significant modifications to your file.
To discard the file without saving your changes,
activate the individual file menu (at the top-left corner of the
edit window) either by clicking on the gadget with the mouse or by
pressing
:HILITE.ALT_W
:PERIOD.
When the menu is up, try selecting the
:HILITE.Close
item.  You will get the message:
:ILLUST.
File modified - use :q! to force
:eILLUST.
The command ":q!" being referred to will be discussed later.  The
file can be exited without saving by using the
:HILITE.Close no save
menu item.  Activate the individual file menu again, and select this
item.  This will discard your changes to the file, and since you
are not editing any other files, you are returned to the operating system
command prompt.
