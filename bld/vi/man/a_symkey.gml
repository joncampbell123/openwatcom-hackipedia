:CMT :SECTION.Introduction
When mapping keys using the
:KEYWORD.map
command, and unmapping keys using the
:KEYWORD.unmap
command, it is useful to be able to specify the key that you are
mapping symbolically, especially if it is a function key, a cursor key
or other special key.  There are a number of pre-defined keys
symbols that are recognized when specifying which key is being mapped/unmapped.
.np
The next section describes the symbol used to represent the key, and
what the key actually is.  These symbols are also used throughout
this guide to represent a special key.
