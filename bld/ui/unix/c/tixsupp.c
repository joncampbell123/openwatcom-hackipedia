        Client overridable aspects of the TIX support.

        ui_tix_path     is the last chance directory for finding TIX files
                        (the trailing slash is required).

        ui_tix_missing  is called when UI can not find the appropriate TIX
                        file. The parm is the name of the TIX file being
                        looked for (minus the trailing ".tix"). If the
                        function returns zero, the UI library initialization
                        will fail (uiinit will return FALSE). Returning a
                        non-zero value will allow UI library initialization
                        to succeed (assuming nothing else goes wrong).
