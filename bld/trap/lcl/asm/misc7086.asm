comment ~
    These routines read/write the FPU or emulator state when we're on a 386
    or better. They're a bit wierd so here's a explanation. There are operand
    size overrides on the fnsave and fnrstor so that a real FPU will save the
    full 32-bit state (this code is in a 16-bit segment). The emulator does
    not respect the operand size, but since it always stores the full state
    anyway that's OK. However, the 32-bit emulator does not know how to decode
    a 16-bit addressing mode - it always interprets things as if they were in
    the 32-bit form. That means that the [bx] addressing mode gets interpreted
    as [edi], which is why there are "movzx edi,bx" instructions. before the
    coprocessor instructions.
