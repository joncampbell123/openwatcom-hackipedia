#pmake: build trap remote os_os2 cpu_386 par

host_os  = os2
host_cpu = i86

# This is a quick and dirty project because it is OS/2 specific and
# intended to be temporary; Yes, I know it breaks all known rules. Once
# WLINK properly supports 16-bit IOPL segments in 32-bit DLLs, the port
# I/O can be built into the parallel trap file/server modules, which is
# where it belongs in the first place.
