                    Open Watcom WattTCP Library
                    ===========================

This library is included here to support building the DOS 16-bit TCP/IP
remote debug server for remote TCP/IP debugging under DOS. The library
has been stripped down to the bare essentials that are needed just
for this purpose, so if you want the full library you can get it from
here:

To build the library, go to the src subdirectory and run 'wmake -ms'.
