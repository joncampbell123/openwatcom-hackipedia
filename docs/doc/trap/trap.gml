.chap *refid=Introd1 Introduction
The &company debugger consists of a number of separate pieces of code. The
main executable, WD.EXE (wd on UNIX systems), provides a debugging `engine'
and user interface.
When the engine wishes to perform an operation upon the program being
debugged such as reading memory or setting a breakpoint, it creates
a request structure and sends it to the `trap file' (so called because
under DOS, it contains the first level trap handlers). The trap file
examines the request structure, performs the indicated action and returns
a result structure to the debugger. The debugger and trap files also use
Machine Architecture Description (MAD) files which abstract the CPU
architecture.
This design has the following benefits:
:OL.
:LI. OS debugging interfaces tend to be wildly varying in how they are accessed.
By moving all the OS specific interface code into the trap file and having
a defined interface to access it, porting the debugger becomes much easier.
:LI. By abstracting the machine architecture specifics through MAD files, it
becomes possible to use one debugger for several target CPU architectures
(such as x86 and Alpha AXP). Unlike most other debuggers, the &company
debugger is not tied to a single host/target combination and if appropriate
trap and MAD files are available, the debugger running on any host can
remotely debug any target.
:LI. The trap file does not have to actually perform the operation. Instead
it could send the request out to a remote server by a communication link
such as a serial line or LAN. The remote server can retrieve the request,
perform the operation on the remote machine and send the results back
via the link. This enables the debugger to debug applications
in cases where there are memory constraints or other considerations which
prevent the debugger proper from running on the remote system (such as
Novell Netware 386).
:eOL.
:P.
This document describes the interface initially used by version 4.0 of the
WATCOM debugger (shipped with the 10.0 C/C++ and FORTRAN releases). It has
been revised to describe changes incorporated in Watcom 11.0 release, as
well as subsequent Open Watcom releases. It
is expected to be modified in future releases. Where possible, notification
of expected changes are given in the document, but all aspects are subject
to revision.
.section Some Definitions
.np
Next follow some general trap definitions.
.beglevel
.section Byte Order
.np
The trap file interface is defined to use little endian byte order. That is,
the least significant byte is stored at the lowest address. Little endian
byte order was chosen for compatibility with existing trap files and
tools. Fixed byte order also eases network communication between
debuggers and trap files running on machines with different byte order.
.section Pointer Sizes
.np
In a 16-bit hosted environment such as DOS, all pointers used by the trap
file are "far" 16:16 pointers. In a 32-bit environment such as Windows NT
the pointers are "near" 0:32 pointers.
.section Base Types
.np
A number of basic types are used in the interface. They are defined
as follows:
:DL.
:DTHD.Type
:DDHD.Definition
:DT.unsigned_8
:DD.1 byte unsigned quantity
:DT.unsigned_16
:DD.2 byte unsigned quantity
:DT.unsigned_32
:DD.4 byte unsigned quantity
:DT.access_req
:DD.The first field of every request is of this type. It is a 1 byte field
which identifies the request to be performed.
:DT.addr48_ptr
:DD.This type encapsulates the concept of a 16:32 pointer.
All addresses in the debuggee memory
are described with these. The debugger
always acts as if the debuggee were in a 32-bit large model environment since
the 32-bit flat model and all 16-bit memory models are subsets.
The structure is defined as follows:
.np
:XMP.
typedef struct {
    unsigned_32    offset;
    unsigned_16    segment;
} addr48_ptr;
:eXMP.
The :F.segment:eF. field contains the segment of the address and the :F.offset:eF.
field stores the offset of the address.
:DT.bytes
:DD.The type :F.bytes:eF. is an array of unsigned_8.
The length is provided
by other means. Typically a field of type :F.bytes:eF. is the last one in
a request and the length is calculated from the total length of the request.
:DT.string
:DD.The type :F.string:eF. is actually an array of characters.
The array is terminated by a null ('\0') character.
The length is provided
by other means. Typically a field of type :F.string:eF. is the last one in
a request and the length is calculated from the total length of the request.
:DT.trap_error
:DD.
Some trap file requests return debuggee operating system error codes, notably
the requests to perform file I/O on the remote system. These error codes are
returned as an unsigned_32. The debugger considers the value zero to indicate
no error.
:DT.trap_phandle
:DD.This is an :F.unsigned_32:eF. which holds process (task) handle. A task
handle is used to uniquely identify a debuggee process.
:DT.trap_mhandle
:DD.This is an :F.unsigned_32:eF. which holds a module handle. Typically the
main executable will be one module, and on systems which support DLLs or
shared libraries, each library will be identified by a unique module handle.
:eDL.
.endlevel
.chap The Request Interface
Next follow detailed description of interface elements.
.section Request Structure.
.np
Each request is a composed of two sequences of bytes provided by the
debugger called messages. The first set contains the actual request
code and whatever
parameters that are required by the request. The second sequence is where
the result of the operation is to be stored by the trap file.
:P.
The two sequences need not be contiguous. The sequences are described
to the trap file through two arrays of message entry structures.
This allows the debugger to avoid unnecessary packing and unpacking of
messages, since :F.mx_entry:eF.'s can be set to point directly at
parameter/result buffers.
:P.
Multiple requests are :HP2.not:eHP2. allowed in a single message. The
:F.mx_entry:eF.'s are only used to provide scatter/gather capabilities for
one request at a time.
:P.
The message entry structure is as follows (defined in :F.trptypes.h:eF.):
.np
:XMP.
typedef struct {
    void            *ptr;
    unsigned        len;
} mx_entry;
:eXMP.
:PC.
The :F.ptr:eF. is pointing to a block of data for that message entry.
The :F.len:eF. field gives the length of that block.
One array of :F.mx_entry:eF.'s describes the request message. The second array
describes the return message.
:P.
It is not legal to split a message into arbitrary pieces with mx_entries.
Each request documents where an :F.mx_entry:eF. is allowed to start with a
line of dashes.
.section The Interface Routines
.np
The trap file interface must provide three routines: :F.TrapInit:eF.,
:F.TrapRequest:eF., and :F.TrapFini:eF.. How the debugger determines the
address of these routines after loading a trap file, as well as the calling
convention used, is system dependent and described later. These functions are
prototyped in :F.trpimp.h:eF..
.beglevel
.section TrapInit
.np
This function initializes the environment for proper operation of
:F.TrapRequest:eF..
.np
:XMP.
trap_version TRAPENTRY TrapInit( 
    char       *parm,
    char       *error,
    unsigned_8 remote
);
:eXMP.
:PC.
The :F.parm:eF. is a string that the user passes to the trap file. Its
interpretation is completely up to the trap file. In the case of the
&company debugger,
all the characters following the semicolon in the :F./TRAP:eF. option are
passed as the :F.parm:eF.. For example:
.np
:XMP.
wd /trap=nov;testing program
:eXMP.
:P.
The :F.parm:eF. would be "testing".
Any error message
will be returned in :F.error:eF.. The :F.remote:eF. field
is a zero if the &company debugger is loading the trap file and a one if a
remote server is loading it.
This function returns a structure :F.trap_version:eF. of the following form
(defined in :F.trptypes.h:eF.):
.np
:XMP.
typedef struct {
    unsigned_8  major;
    unsigned_8  minor;
    unsigned_8  remote;
} trap_version;
:eXMP.
:PC.
The :F.major:eF. field contains the major version number of the trap file while
the :F.minor:eF. field tells the minor version number of the trap file.
:F.Major:eF. is changed whenever there is a modification made to the trap file
that is not upwardly compatable with previous versions. :F.Minor:eF.
increments by one whenever a change is made to the trap file that is upwardly
compatible with previous versions.
The current major verion is &trp_majver., the current minor version is &trp_minver..
The :F.remote:eF. field informs the
debugger whether the trap file communicates with a remote machine.
:P.
:F.TrapInit:eF. must be called before using :F.TrapRequest:eF. to send a request.
Failure to do so may result in unpredictable operation of :F.TrapRequest:eF..
.section TrapRequest
.np
All requests between the server and the remote trap file are handled by
TrapRequest.
.np
:XMP.
unsigned TRAPENTRY TrapRequest(
    unsigned num_in_mx,
    mx_entry *mx_in,
    unsigned num_out_mx,
    mx_entry *mx_out
);
:eXMP.
:PC.
The :F.mx_in:eF. points to an array of request mx_entry's.
The :F.num_in_mx:eF.
field contains the number of elements of the array. Similarly,
the :F.mx_out:eF.
will point to an array of return mx_entry's. The number of elements
will be
given by the :F.num_out_mx:eF. field. The total number of bytes actually
filled in to the return message by the trap file is returned by the
function (this may be less than the total number of bytes described by
the :F.mx_out:eF. array).
:P.Since every request must start with an :F.access_req:eF. field, the
minimum size of a request message is one byte.
:P.
Some requests do not require a return message. In this case, the program
invoking TrapRequest :HP2.must:eHP2. pass zero for :F.num_out_mx:eF. and NULL for
:F.mx_out:eF..
.beglevel
.section Request Example
.np
The request REQ_READ_MEM needs the memory address and length
of memory to read as input and will return the memory block in the
output message. To read 30 bytes of memory from address 0x0010:0x8000 into
a buffer, we can write:
.np
:XMP.
mx_entry        in[1];
mx_entry        out[1];
unsigned char   buffer[30];
struct in_msg_def {
    access_req          req;
    addr48_ptr          addr;
    unsigned_16         len;
} in_msg = { REQ_READ_MEM, { 0x8000, 0x0010 }, sizeof( buffer ) };

unsigned_16 mem_blk_len;

in[0].ptr = &in_msg;
in[0].len = sizeof( in_msg );
out[0].ptr = &buffer;
out[0].len = sizeof( buffer );

mem_blk_len = TrapRequest( 1, in, 1, out );

if( mem_blk_length != sizeof( buffer ) ) {
    printf( "Error in reading memory\n" );
} else {
    printf( "OK\n" );
}
:eXMP.
:PC.
The program will print "OK" if it has transferred 30 bytes of data from the
debuggee's address space to the :F.buffer:eF. variable. If less than 30
bytes is transfered, an error message is printed out.
.endlevel
.section TrapFini
.np
The function terminates the link between the debugger and the trap file.
It should be called
after finishing all access requests.
.np
:XMP.
void TRAPENTRY TrapFini( void );
:eXMP.
:PC.
After calling :F.TrapFini:eF., it is illegal to call :F.TrapRequest:eF.
without calling :F.TrapInit:eF. again.
.endlevel
.chap The Requests
This section descibes the individual requests, their parameters, and
their return values. A line of dashes indicates where an :F.mx_entry:eF. is
allowed (but not required) to start.
The debugger allows
(via REQ_GET_SUPPLEMENTARY_SERVICE/REQ_PERFORM_SUPPLEMENTARY_SERVICE) optional
components to be implemented only on specific systems.
:P.
The numeric value of the request which is placed in the :F.req:eF. field
follows the symbolic name in parentheses.
.section Core Requests
.np
These requests need to be implemented in all versions of the trap file,
although some of them may only be stub implementations in some environments.
Note that structures suitable for individual requests are declared in
:F.trpcore.h:eF..
.beglevel
.section REQ_CONNECT (0)
.np
Request to connect to the remote machine. This must be the first request made.
:P.
:F.Request message::eF.
.np
:XMP.
access_req      req
unsigned_8      major;   <-+- struct trap_version
unsigned_8      minor;     |
unsigned_8      remote;  <-+
:eXMP.
:PC.
The :F.req:eF. field contains the request.
The :F.trap_version:eF.
structure tells the version of the program making the request. The :F.major:eF.
field contains the major version number of the trap file while the :F.minor:eF.
field tells the minor version number of the trap file. The :F.major:eF. is
changed whenever there is a modification made to the trap file that is not
upwardly compatable with previous versions. The :F.minor:eF. increments by one
whenever a change is made to the trap file that is upwardly compatable with
previous versions. The current major version is &trp_majver., the current minor version
is &trp_minver..
The :F.remote:eF. field informs the trap file whether a
remote server is between the &company debugger and the trap file.
:P.
:F.Return message::eF.
.np
:XMP.
unsigned_16 max_msg_size
----------------------------
string      err_msg
:eXMP.
:PC.
If error has occurred, the :F.err_msg:eF. field will returns the error
message string. If there is no error, :F.error_msg:eF. returns a null character
and the field
:F.max_msg_size:eF. will contain the allowed maximum size of a message in
bytes. Any message
(typically reading/writing memory or files)
which would require more than the maximum number of bytes
to transmit or receive must be broken up into multiple requests.
The minimum acceptable value for this
field is 256.
.section REQ_DISCONNECT (1)
.np
Request to terminate the link between the local and remote machine.
After this request, a REQ_CONNECT must be the next one made.
:P.
:F.Request message::eF.
.np
:XMP.
access_req      req
:eXMP.
:PC.
The :F.req:eF. field contains the request.
:P.
:F.Return message::eF.
.np
:XMP.
NONE
:eXMP.
.section REQ_SUSPEND (2)
.np
Request to suspend the link between the server and the remote trap file.
The debugger issues this message just before it spawns a sub-shell (the
"system" command). This allows a remote server to enter a state where
it allows other trap files to connect to it (normally, once a remote server
has connected to a trap file, the remote link will fail any other attempts
to connect to it). This allows the user for instance to start up an RFX
process and transfer any missing files to the remote machine before
continuing the debugging process.
:P.
:F.Request message::eF.
.np
:XMP.
access_req      req
:eXMP.
:PC.
The :F.req:eF. field contains the request.
:P.
:F.Return message::eF.
.np
:XMP.
NONE
:eXMP.
.section REQ_RESUME (3)
.np
Request to resume the link between the server and the remote trap file.
The debugger issues this request when the spawned sub-shell exits.
:P.
:F.Request message::eF.
.np
:XMP.
access_req      req
:eXMP.
:PC.
The :F.req:eF. field contains the request.
:P.
:F.Return message::eF.
.np
:XMP.
NONE
:eXMP.
.section REQ_GET_SUPPLEMENTARY_SERVICE (4)
.np
Request to obtain a supplementary service id.
:P.
:F.Request message::eF.
.np
:XMP.
access_req  req
------------------------
string      service_name
:eXMP.
:PC.
The :F.req:eF. field contains the request. The :F.service_name:eF field
contains a string identifying the supplementary service. This string is
case insensitive.
:P.
:F.Return message::eF.
.np
:XMP.
trap_error      err;
trap_shandle    id;
:eXMP.
:PC.
The :F.err:eF. field is non-zero if something went wrong in obtaining
or initializing the service.
:F.Id:eF. is the identifier for a particular supplementary service.
It need not be the same from one invocation of the trap file to another.
If both it and the :F.err:eF. field are zero, it means that the
service is not available from this trap file.
:NOTE. In the future, we might allow for user developed add-ons to be
integrated with the debugger. There would be two components, one to be
added to the debugger and one to be added to the trap file. The two
pieces could communicate with each other via the supplementary services
mechanism.
.section REQ_PERFORM_SUPPLEMENTARY_SERVICE (5)
.np
Request to perform a supplementary service.
:P.
:F.Request message::eF.
.np
:XMP.
access_req  req
unsigned_32 service_id
------------------------
unspecified
:eXMP.
:PC.
The :F.req:eF. field contains the request. The :F.service_id:eF field
indicates which service is being requested. The remainder of the request
is specified by the individual supplementary service provider.
:P.
:F.Return message::eF.
.np
:XMP.
unspecified
:eXMP.
:PC.
The return message is specified by the individual supplementary service
provider.
.section REQ_GET_SYS_CONFIG (6)
.np
Request to get system information from the remote machine.
:P.
:F.Request message::eF.
.np
:XMP.
access_req      req
:eXMP.
:PC.
The :F.req:eF. field contains the request.
:P.
:F.Return message::eF.
.np
:XMP.
unsigned_8  cpu;
unsigned_8  fpu;
unsigned_8  osmajor;
unsigned_8  osminor;
unsigned_8  os;
unsigned_8  huge_shift;
mad_handle  mad;
:eXMP.
:PC.
The :F.mad:eF. field specifies the MAD (Machine Architecture Description) in use
and determines how the other fields will be interpreted. Currently the following
MADs are used:
.np
:XMP.
MAD_X86 - Intel IA-32 compatible
MAD_AXP - Alpha AXP
MAD_PPC - PowerPC
:eXMP.
:PC.
The :F.cpu:eF. fields returns the type of the remote CPU. The size of that field
is unsigned_8. Possible CPU types for MAD_X86 are:
.np
:XMP.
bits 0-3
   X86_86  = 0   - 8086
   X86_186 = 1   - 80186
   X86_286 = 2   - 80286
   X86_386 = 3   - 80386
   X86_486 = 4   - 80486
   X86_586 = 5   - Pentium
   X86_686 = 6   - Pentium Pro/II/III
   X86_P4  = 15  - Pentium 4
bit  4           - MM registers
bit  5           - XMM registers
bits 6,7         - unused
:eXMP.
:PC.
The :F.fpu:eF. fields tells the type of FPU. The size of the field is unsigned_8.
FPU types for MAD_X86 include:
.np
:XMP.
X86_EMU = -1     - Software emulated FPU
X86_NO  =  0     - No FPU
X86_87  =  1     - 8087
X86_287 =  2     - 80287
X86_387 =  3     - 80387
X86_487 =  4     - 486 integrated FPU
X86_587 =  5     - Pentium integrated FPU
X86_587 =  6     - Pentium Pro/II/III integrated FPU
X86_P47 =  15    - Pentium 4 integrated FPU
:eXMP.
:PC.
The :F.osmajor:eF. and :F.osminor:eF. contains the major and minor version
number for the operating system of the remote machine. The type of operating
system can be found in
:F.os:eF. field. The size of this field is unsigned_8. The OS can be:
.np
:XMP.
OS_IDUNNO    =  0   - Unknown operating system
OS_DOS       =  1   - DOS
OS_OS2       =  2   - OS/2
OS_PHAR      =  3   - Phar Lap 386 DOS Extender
OS_ECLIPSE   =  4   - Eclipse 386 DOS Extender (obsolete)
OS_NW386     =  5   - NetWare 386
OS_QNX       =  6   - QNX 4.x
OS_RATIONAL  =  7   - DOS/4G or compatible
OS_WINDOWS   =  8   - Windows 3.x
OS_PENPOINT  =  9   - PenPoint (obsolete)
OS_NT        = 10   - Win32
OS_AUTOCAD   = 11   - ADS/ADI development (obsolete)
OS_NEUTRINO  = 12   - QNX 6.x
OS_LINUX     = 13   - Linux
:eXMP.
:PC.
The :F.huge_shift:eF. field is used to determine the shift needed for huge
arithmetic in that system. It stores the number of left shifts required in order
to calculate the next segment correctly. It is 12 for real mode programs. The
value in a protect mode environment must be obtained from the OS of the debuggee
machine. This field is only relevant for 16-bit segmented architectures.
.section REQ_MAP_ADDR (7)
.np
Request to map the input address to the actual address of the remote machine.
The addresses in the symbolic information provided by the linker do not
reflect any relocation performed on the executable by the system loader. This
request obtains that relocation information so that the debugger can update
its addresses.
:P.
:F.Request message::eF.
.np
:XMP.
access_req      req;
addr48_ptr      in_addr;
trap_mhandle    handle;
:eXMP.
:PC.
The :F.req:eF. field contains the request. The :F.in_addr:eF. tells the address
to map. The :F.handle:eF. field identifies the module which the address is
from. The value from this field is obtained by REQ_PROG_LOAD or
REQ_GET_LIB_NAME. There are two magical values for the :F.in_addr.segment:eF.
field.
.np
:XMP.
MAP_FLAT_CODE_SELECTOR  = -1
MAP_FLAT_DATA_SELECTOR  = -2
:eXMP.
:PC.
When the :F.in_addr.segment:eF. equals one of these values, the debugger
does not have a map segment value and is requesting that the trap file
performs the mapping as if the given offset was in the flat address space.
:P.
:F.Return message::eF.
.np
:XMP.
addr48_ptr      out_addr
addr48_off      lo_bound;
addr48_off      hi_bound;
:eXMP.
:PC.
The mapped address is returned in :F.out_addr:eF.. Note that in addition
to the segment portion being modified, the offset of the portion of the
address may be adjusted as well if the loader performs offset relocations
(like OS/2 2.x or Windows NT). The :F.lo_bound:eF. and :F.hi_bound:eF. fields
identify the lowest and highest input offsets for which this mapping is
valid. If the debugger needs to map another address whose input segment value
is the same as a previous request, and the input offset falls within the
valid range identified by the return of that previous request, it can
perform the mapping itself and not bother sending the request to the trap
file.
.section REQ_ADDR_INFO (8)
.np
This request is x86 specific and obsolete; REQ_MACHINE_DATA should be used
instead. It needs to be provided only for backwards compatibility.
:P.
Request to check if a given address is using 32-bit addressing (the
386 compatible CPU's current selector's B-bit is on) by
default. The debugger requires this information to properly disassemble
instructions.
:P.
:F.Request message::eF.
.np
:XMP.
access_req      req
addr48_ptr      in_addr
:eXMP.
:PC.
The :F.req:eF. field contains the request and the :F.in_addr:eF. tells the input
address.
:P.
:F.Return message::eF.
.np
:XMP.
unsigned_8      is_32
:eXMP.
:PC.
The field returns one if the address is a USE32 segment, zero otherwise.
.section REQ_CHECKSUM_MEM (9)
.np
Request to calculate the checksum for a block of memory in the debuggee's
address space.
This is used by the debugger to determine if the contents of the memory block
have changed since the last time it was read. Since only a four byte
checksum has to be transmitted back, it is more efficient than actually
reading the memory again. The debugger does not care how the checksum
is calculated.
:P.
:F.Request message::eF.
.np
:XMP.
access_req      req;
addr48_ptr      in_addr;
unsigned_16     len;
:eXMP.
:PC.
The :F.req:eF. field stores the request. The :F.in_addr:eF. contains the
starting address and the :F.len:eF. field tells how large the block of memory is.
:P.
:F.Return message::eF.
.np
:XMP.
unsigned_32     result
:eXMP.
:PC.
The checksum will be returned in :F.result:eF..
.section REQ_READ_MEM (10)
.np
Request to read a block of memory.
:P.
:F.Request message::eF.
.np
:XMP.
access_req      req;
addr48_ptr      mem_addr;
unsigned_16     len;
:eXMP.
:PC.
The :F.mem_addr:eF. contains the address of the memory block to read from the
remote machine. The length of the block is determined by :F.len:eF.. The
memory data will be copied to output message.
:P.
:F.Return message::eF.
.np
:XMP.

:eXMP.
:PC.
The :F.data:eF. field contains the register information requested. Its format
is the same as the result of a "fsave" instruction in a 32-bit segment (the
instruction pointer and operand pointer fields take up 8 bytes each).
Implementations of trap files in 16-bit environments should expand the
instruction pointer and operand pointer fields from 4 bytes to 8 (shuffling
the data register fields down in memory) before returning the result to
the debugger.
.section REQ_WRITE_CPU (16)/REQ_WRITE_FPU (17)
.np
These requests are x86 specific and obsolete; REQ_WRITE_REGS should be used
instead. They needs to be provided only for backwards compatibility.

:eXMP.
:P.
Information in :F.data:eF. field will be transfered to the debuggee's
registers. The formats of data can be found in
REQ_READ_CPU/REQ_READ_FPU
:NOTE.
For the REQ_WRITE_FPU case, the data will be in a 32-bit "fsave" instruction
format,
so 16-bit environments will have to squish the instruction and operand
pointer fields back to their 4 byte forms.
:P.
:F.Return message::eF.
.np

NONE
:eXMP.
:PC.
.section REQ_PROG_GO (18)/REQ_PROG_STEP (19)
.np
Requests to execute the debuggee. REQ_PROG_GO causes the debuggee to
resume execution, while REQ_PROG_STEP requests only a single machine
instruction to be executed before returning. In either case, this
request will return when a breakpoint, watchpoint, machine exception
or other significant event has been encountered. While executing, a
trap file is allowed to return spurious COND_WATCH indications.
The debugger always checks its own watchpoint table for changes before
reporting to the user. This means that a legal implementation of a trap
file (but :HP2.very:eHP2. inefficient) can just single step the program and return
COND_WATCH for every instruction when there are active watchpoints
present.
:P.
:F.Request message::eF.

Bit 8   : COND_WATCH            - Watch point occurred
Bit 9   : COND_USER             - User interrupt
Bit 10  : COND_TERMINATE        - Program terminated
Bit 11  : COND_EXCEPTION        - Machine exception
Bit 12  : COND_MESSAGE          - Message to be displayed
Bit 13  : COND_STOP             - Debuggee wants to stop
Bit 14  : not used
Bit 15  : not used
:eXMP.
When a bit is off, the debugger avoids having to make additional requests
to determine the new state of the debuggee. If the trap file is not sure
that a particular item has changed, or if it is expensive to find out, it
should just turn the bit on.

.section REQ_GET_NEXT_ALIAS (26)
.np
Request to get alias information for a segment. In some protect mode
environments (typically 32-bit flat) two different selectors may refer
to the same physical memory. Which selectors do this is important to
the debugger in certain cases (so that symbolic information is properly
displayed).

:eXMP.
:PC.
The :F.handle:eF. field contains the library handle. It contains zero if
there are no more DLL names to be returned. The name of the library will be returned in
:F.name:eF. field. If the :F.name:eF. field is an empty string (consists
just of the '\0' character), then this is a indication that the DLL indicated
by the given handle has been unloaded, and the debugger should remove
any symbolic information for the image. It is an error to attempt to remove
a handle that has not been loaded in a previous REQ_GET_LIB_NAME request.
.section REQ_GET_ERR_TEXT (31)
.np
Request to get the error message text for an error code.
:P.

indicating the type of error that has been detected.
.np
:NOTE. 2008/07/17: Standard I/O redirection is not currently supported on all trap files
and almost all of them also do not return an accurate error code for failures. This is work
in progress. The debugger may report an error to open the specified file rather than report
that the requested operation is not supported.

.section File I/O requests
.np
This section describes requests that deal with file input/output on the
target (debuggee) machine.
These requests are actually performed by the
core request REQ_PERFORM_SUPPLEMENTARY_SERVICE and appropriate service ID.
The following descriptions do not show that "prefix" to the
request messages.
:P.
The service name to be used in the REQ_GET_SUPPLEMENTARY_SERVICE is
"Files".
:P.
The file requests use a new basic type in addition to the ones already
described:

The
:F.ext_separator:eF. contains the separator for file name extensions. The possible
path separators can be found in array :F.path_separator:eF.. The first one is the
"preferred" path separator for that operating system.
This is the path separator that the debugger will use if it needs to construct
a file name for the remote system.
The new line control
characters are stored in array :F.newline:eF.. If the operating system uses only
a single character for newline, put a zero in the second element.
.section REQ_FILE_OPEN (1)

.section Overlay requests
.np
This section describes requests that deal with overlays (supported
only under 16-bit DOS).
These requests are actually performed by the
core request REQ_PERFORM_SUPPLEMENTARY_SERVICE and appropriate service ID.
The following descriptions do not show that "prefix" to the
request messages.
:P.
The service name to be used in the REQ_GET_SUPPLEMENTARY_SERVICE is
"Overlays".
:P.
The overlay requests use a new basic type in addition to the ones already
described:
:DL.
:DTHD.Type
:DDHD.Definition
:DT.addr32_ptr
:DD.This type encapsulates the concept of a 16:16 pointer into the
debuggee's address space. Since overlays are
only useful for 16-bit environments, using the addr48_ptr type would be
inefficient.
The structure is defined as follows:
.np
:XMP.
typedef struct {
    unsigned_16    offset;
    unsigned_16    segment;
} addr32_ptr;
:eXMP.
The :F.segment:eF. field contains the segment of the address and the :F.offset:eF.
field stores the offset of the address.
:DT.ovl_address

.chap System Dependent Aspects
Every environment has a different method of loading the code for the trap
file and locating the TrapInit, TrapRequest, and TrapFini routines. This
section descibes how the &company debugger performs these operations for
the various systems.
.section Trap Files Under DOS
.np
A trap file is an "EXE" format file with the extension ".TRP". The
debugger searches the directories specified by the PATH environment variable.
Once found, it is loaded into memory and has the normal EXE style relocations
applied to the image. Then the lowest address in the load image (NOTE: not
the starting address from EXE header information) is examined for the
following structure:
.np
:XMP.
typedef struct {
    unsigned_16     signature; /* == 0xDEAF */
    unsigned_16     init_off;
    unsigned_16     acc_off;
    unsigned_16     fini_off;
} trap_header;
:eXMP.
:PC.
If the first 2 bytes contain the value 0xDEAF, the file is considered to
be a valid trap file and the :F.init_off:eF., :F.acc_off:eF., and
:F.fini_off:eF. fields are used to obtain the offsets of the TrapInit,
TrapRequest, and TrapFini routines repectively.
:P.
The starting address field of the EXE header should be set to point at
some code which prints out a message about not being able to be run from
the command line and then terminates.
.section Trap Files Under OS/2
.np
A trap file is a normal OS/2 DLL. The system automatically searches the
directories specified by the LIBPATH command in the CONFIG.SYS file. Once
loaded, the &company debugger uses export ordinal 1 from the DLL for TrapInit, export
ordinal 2 for TrapFini and export ordinal 3 for TrapRequest.
Some example code follows:
.np
:XMP.
rc = DosLoadModule( NULL, 0, trap_file_name, &dll_module );
if( rc != 0 ) {
    return( "unable to load trap file" );
}
if( DosGetProcAddr( dll_module, "#1", &TrapInit ) != 0
 || DosGetProcAddr( dll_module, "#2", &TrapFini ) != 0
 || DosGetProcAddr( dll_module, "#3", &TrapRequest ) != 0 ) 
{
    return( "incorrect version of trap file" );
}
:eXMP.
.section Trap Files Under Windows.
.np
A trap file is a normal Windows DLL. The system automatically searches the
directories specified by the PATH environment variable.
Once
loaded, the &company debugger uses export ordinal 2 from the DLL for TrapInit, export
ordinal 3 for TrapFini and export ordinal 4 for TrapRequest.
Some example code follows:
.np
:XMP.
dll = LoadLibrary( trap_file_name );
if( dll < 32 ) {
    return( "unable to load trap file" );
}
TrapInit   = (LPVOID) GetProcAddress( dll, (LPSTR)2 );
TrapFini   = (LPVOID) GetProcAddress( dll, (LPSTR)3 );
TrapRequest = (LPVOID) GetProcAddress( dll, (LPSTR)4 );
if( TrapInit == NULL || TrapFini == NULL || TrapRequest == NULL ) {
    return( "incorrect version of trap file" );
}
:eXMP.
.section Trap Files Under Windows NT.
.np
A trap file is a normal Windows NT DLL. The system automatically searches the
directories specified by the PATH environment variable.
Once
loaded, the &company debugger uses export ordinal 1 from the DLL for TrapInit, export
ordinal 2 for TrapFini and export ordinal 3 for TrapRequest.
Some example code follows:
.np
:XMP.
dll = LoadLibrary( trap_file_name );
if( dll < 32 ) {
    return( "unable to load trap file" );
}
TrapInit   = (LPVOID) GetProcAddress( dll, (LPSTR)1 );
TrapFini   = (LPVOID) GetProcAddress( dll, (LPSTR)2 );
TrapRequest = (LPVOID) GetProcAddress( dll, (LPSTR)3 );
if( TrapInit == NULL || TrapFini == NULL || TrapRequest == NULL ) {
    return( "incorrect version of trap file" );
}
:eXMP.
.section Trap Files Under QNX
.np
A trap file is a QNX load module format file with the extension ".trp"
and whose file permissions are not marked as executable. The
debugger searches the directories specified by the WD_PATH environment variable
and then the "/usr/watcom/wd" directory.
Once found, it is loaded into memory and has the normal loader relocations
applied to the image. Then the lowest address in the load image (NOTE: not
the starting address from load module header information) is examined for the
following structure:
.np
:XMP.
typedef struct {
    unsigned_16     signature; /* == 0xDEAF */
    unsigned_16     init_off;
    unsigned_16     acc_off;
    unsigned_16     fini_off;
} trap_header;
:eXMP.
:PC.
If the first 2 bytes contain the value 0xDEAF, the file is considered to
be a valid trap file and the :F.init_off:eF., :F.acc_off:eF., and
:F.fini_off:eF. fields are used to obtain the offsets of the TrapInit,
TrapRequest, and TrapFini routines repectively.
:P.
The starting address field of the load image header should be set to point at
some code which prints out a message about not being able to be run from
the command line and then terminates.
.section Trap Files Under Netware 386
.np
The trap file routines are linked directly into the remote server code and
TrapInit, TrapRequest, TrapFini are directly called.
