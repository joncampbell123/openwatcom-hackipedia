&product is an implementation of the American National Standard
programming language FORTRAN, ANSI X3.9-1978, commonly referred to as
FORTRAN 77.
The language level supported by this compiler includes the full
language definition as well as significant extensions to the language.
&cmpname is based upon some well known FORTRAN language compilers,
namely the University of Waterloo's WATFOR and WATFIV-S compilers
(implementations for the International Business Machines 370 series)
and the WATFOR-11 compiler (an implementation for the Digital
Equipment PDP11).

This User's Guide provides system specific information on the use of
&product on computer systems running DOS or OS/2 2.0.

We would like to thank IMSL of Houston, Texas for providing us
with copies of their Mathematics and Statistics libraries.
The IMSL
.us Math Library
is a collection of subprograms for mathematical problem solving
and the
.us Statistics Library
is a collection of subprograms for statistical analysis.
The self test procedures provided with these libraries proved to be an
immense help in testing &cmpname on the personal computer.
.np
We also used the "FORTRAN Compiler Validation System, Version 2.0" to
test the conformance of &cmpname with the full FORTRAN 77 language
standard.
This package is provided by the National Technical Information Service
of the U.S. Department of Commerce in Springfield,
Virginia.
The validation system was developed by the Federal Software Testing
Center.
