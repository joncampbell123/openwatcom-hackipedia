This book was produced with the WATCOM GML electronic publishing
system, a software tool developed and sold by WATCOM.
In this system, writers use any ASCII text editor to create source files
containing text annotated with tags.
These tags label the structural elements of the document, such as
chapters, sections, paragraphs, and lists.
The WATCOM GML software, which runs on the MS DOS, IBM VM/SP CMS, and
Digital VAX/VMS operating systems, interprets the tags to format the
text into a form such as you see here.
Writers can produce output for a variety of printers, including laser
printers, using separately specified layout directives for such things
as font selection, column width and height, number of columns, etc.
The result is type-set quality copy containing integrated text and
graphics.
